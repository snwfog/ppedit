  # Prepare your internal $this reference.

  # Store your default settings in something "private".
  # The simplest way to do so is to abide by the convention that anything
  # named with a leading underscore is part of the private API (a well-known
  # interface contract in the JavaScript community).
  _settings =
    default: 'cool!'

  # You *may* rely on internal, private objects:
  _flag = false
  _anotherState = null
  _editor = null

  # This is your public API (no leading underscore, see?)
  # All public methods must return $this so your plugin is chainable.

      # An important thing to keep in mind, is that jQuery plugins should be
      # built so that one can apply them to more than one element, like so:
      #
      #  $('.matching-elements, #another-one').foobar()
      #
      # It means the $this object we populated using @ (this) is to be
      # considered an array of selectors, and one must always perform
      # computations while iterating over them:
      #
      #  $this.each (index, el) ->
      #    # do something with el
      #
      _editor = new PPEditor $this

      _editor.bindEvents()
      
      return $this

    doSomething: (what) ->
      # Another public method that people can call and rely on to do "what".
      return $this

    # This method is often overlooked.
    destroy: ->
      # Do anything to clean it up (nullify references, unbind events…).
      return $this

    clearHistory: ->
      _editor.commandManager.clearHistory()
      return $this

    load: (options) ->
      _editor.load options.hunks
      return $this

  # This is your private API. Most of your plugin code should go there.
  # The name "_internals" is by no mean mandatory: pick something you like, don't
  # forget the leading underscore so that the code is self-documented.
  # Those methods do not need to return $this. You may either have them working
  # by side-effects (modifying internal objects, see above) or, in a more
  # functionnal style, pass all required arguments and return a new object.
  # You can access the …settings, or other private methods using …internals.method,
  # as expected.
  _internals =
  # this toggles our "global" yet internal flag:
    toggleFlag: ->
      _flag = !_flag

  # Here is another important part of a proper plugin implementation: the clean
  # namespacing preventing from cluttering the $.fn namespace. This explains why
  # we went the extra miles of providing a pair of public and private APIs.
  # This is also the place where you specify the name of your plugin in your code.
